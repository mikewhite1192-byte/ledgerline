-- The demo reset (0025) clears the agent's records for a demo carrier and rewrites the seeded
-- tables, pay_configs among them. A pay rule change (0030) names a proposal the reset deletes and
-- a version the replace rewrites, so the reset clears these rows too (DEMO_RESET_CLEARED in
-- src/lib/seed/reset.ts). The function is re-created whole, copied from 0025 with one more DELETE
-- and one more returned row, every bound unchanged: the fixed search_path, the demo carrier gate,
-- the tenant row lock, the refusals, a tenant filter on every statement and EXECUTE for payday_app
-- only. A later number than every migration that may re-create it, so on a fresh database this one
-- runs last; any later migration that re-creates it starts from the newest definition and keeps
-- every DELETE in it.
